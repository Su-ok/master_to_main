# Note on Branches

Just wanted to test uploading to the master branch and subsequently transferring files from master to main branch.

## Tips
- If anyone has their local repo set as `master` but the remote repo as `main` (which usually is the case with everyone), they can refer to [this guide](https://github.com/StevenMMortimer/master-to-main/blob/main/README.md) to send files from `master` to `main`.
- Hope it helps :)
